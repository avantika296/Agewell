# Agewell
Payment gateway integration project

In this project I have made a website called Agewll which is an NGO (not a real one) that works for the welfare and empowerment of older persons of India.
It is a basic website developed using HTML5 and CSS. It consists of three pages:

1.Home

2.About

3.Contact

The main part of this project is the Payment page, where I have done the payment gateway integration.
The payment page and payment button is created using Razorpay.
